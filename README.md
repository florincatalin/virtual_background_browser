Virtual Background, Segmentation, Tensorflow, BodyPix, WebRTC, mediaRecorder, webm

Numerous examples of the use of machine learning have emerged recently. An example would be that of virtual backgrounds, using

In addition to creating the virtual background in the browser, I also tried to make a recording of the respective video sequence, using the documentation and examples from WebRTC.
